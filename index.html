    <h1 class="home-h1">Welcome to my Home Page</h1>
    <h3 class="home-h3">This page is mainly dedicated to the people &amp; pets who make up my personality. Also known as my friends &amp; family. Feel free to check out my resume &amp; collection!</h3>
    <h2 class="home-h2">Familia</h2>
    <p>My family consists of my parents, my sister &amp; my niece. Here's a picture of me with my parents &amp; my niece.</p>

    <h2 class="home-h2">Friends</h2>
    <p><strong>Jessy</strong> is my cousin's daughter. She's around my age, &amp; she's basically my best friend in the family. She's the only person who understands my weirdness.</p>

    <p><strong>Jessica</strong> is a mini me, hence me calling her Mija. We met in theatre &amp; since then we've always been each other's rock.</p>

    <p><strong>Geah</strong> is one of my best friends who took me to Six Flags two days after we formally introduced ourselves. I call her my wifey &amp; Gee-Knee-Bah.</p>

    <h2 class="home-h2">Pets</h2>
    <p><strong>Filomeno</strong> is the family pet here in Chicago. He's my father's favorite child &amp; it's kind of sad he gets more instagram likes than me.</p>

    <p>We have my babies who live in Mexico. I miss them so much.</p>
